This is a suitable model for when you expect the response variable to vary as a linear combination of predictor variables.  An example might be predicting the gas mileage of cars, based on their weight, age, and engine size.</li>" + "<li><b>binomial</b> models form an S-curve response, showing probabilities that vary from 0 to 1.  This is a suitable model for when you expect a simple boolean result (e.g. alive/dead, or fraud/no-fraud).  The model gives a probability of the true event.  An example might be to predict the presence of prostate cancer given the patient age, race, and various blood chemical levels such as PSA.</li>"+ "</ul>";
